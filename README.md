# farmone
this project is an  app developed through MIT app inventor, which i want to develop further. This app connects the farmers across the world and helps them to sell their crops across the world!!
It's an app designed through MIT app inverter during my 2nd year for Design thinking project. In my recent days I have revisited it and thought of features I can add more. I'm looking forward to launching my app as soon as I update it.

About app:

We all know that farmers are the backbone of our country.  They produce grains which people consume to survive. They put a lot of hardwork in growing the crops for our survival.
But now-a-days farmers are facing many problems. One of the major problems among them is insufficient crop prices. Though the specific crop has good hold price in 
market,the farmers are not even getting 30% of it.
 
According to a research  104.61 million metric tonnes of vegetables and 57.10 million metric tonnes of fruits are transported to other countries from india every year.
FARMONE provides the channel to connect world wide despite all mediators and mediate sources. this app also ensures that in every 100% of deal 30% of that is charged for the transport and other
things,15% of that is paid as tax to the government and remaining 55% goes to the farmer as crop price. comparing all factors those 55% of the crop price is nearly seven
times to the normal income the farmers get through mediators.

Currently i am working to add a few more features and  embed all the government protocols into this app
